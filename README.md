## Multi-Language Translation Tool

Google Translate API offers a wide array of foreign languages for translation. All 64 below. 
One of my favorite Youtubers has amassed an incredible skill in not only learning new languages, but being able to switch to another language at the drop of the hat in conversation, even further gaining the ability to speak rare, remote languages. This has repeatedly inspired me to attempt to learn new foreign languages.
Below is his Youtube Channel Link:

Google Translate already does translation work, so why would anyone need Langgo? Langgo is a project and experiment in pursuit of MULTIPLE LANGUAGE TRANSLATION simultaneously. User inputs one word or phrase, Langgo outputs to many languages. Repetition is key, and training your brain this method is extremely effective.
I had attempted to build one such application while in school that was limited to six languages, built in vanilla javascript, but was slow and had little adaptability to user needs. Langgo will hopefully help others in their language journey with many updates planned ahead!
